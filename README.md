## John Maras
### 📝 Prime Digital FSE Graduate August '22

I'm a very team focused and driven individual. 
Quiet before you get to know me so I can learn what kind of situation I need to adapt and where I will need to fit into my surroundings. 
Friends have described me as a chameleon, but I prefer to believe I'm just the missing LEGO piece every team needs.
